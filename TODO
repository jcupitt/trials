- added a proper resource for volunteers

- recruiter view

	* users/show

		shows all volunteering

		link to volunteering event redirects to root
		
		http://localhost:3000/volunteers/1

	* volunteers/new

		in recruiter, shows all volunteers for that trial

		needs pagination, filtering

	* volunteers/show

		tries to look up user from id, eg.

		http://localhost:3000/volunteers/121

		fails with user 121 unknow (it's volunteering event 121, not
		user)

	* trials/show

		just shows trial, should show volunteers



	* need filtering on volunteers page

		by user
		free text search

	* link to user and to trial
	
		- trials should show recruters all expressions on that trial

		- user page already shows all expressions I think?

	* notes links to page just for that expression of interest, with
	  ability to add notes, delete etc.

	* a tick box for "responded" which removes from the interest table






- maybe disallow delete trial / delete user / delete volunteer

  useful to keep for records

  instead, mark as invisible

  data protection will require a delete uiser details facility

- on create user_id 0, make an admin

- recruiter: 

  	show volunteering events we've not responded to
	for each response, have a text box for actions, eg. "tried to call on
	tues 4pm, no answer"

	have a box for "responded", volunteer is removed from table
	some way to ignore timewasters? show history for that user
	data protection: do we need to limit recruiters to specific projects?

- link to email, send emails on volunteer

- push notifications

- use markdown for study text

- remove faker from prod
